# Employee-Management-System-JDBC
This project is a console-based Employee Management System developed using Java, JDBC, and MySQL. It demonstrates the integration of application logic with a relational database through JDBC-based connectivity.
The system supports structured CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) for managing employee records. It includes database connection setup, execution of SQL queries from the application layer, handling of result sets, and basic data validation.
The application was developed and executed using VS Code, with MySQL serving as the persistence layer. The project reflects a layered approach where business logic and data storage are connected through JDBC, enabling structured and scalable database interaction.
